# Heart Rate Monitoring

This software allows you to observe your HRM data live. Two plots show Heart Rate and RR Intervals. The plot with RR Intervals gives a crude visualization of Heart Rate Variability.

## Getting Started
To start you have to run hrm_server.py and then connect a compatible Bluetooth Heart Rate Monitor.

Then you can access the Frontend via a browser under http://localhost:12080/.

## Notes
I used Python 3.10.17 to run the server and opened the website in Firefox.

I tried my Heart Rate Chest Strap Monitor I use for cycling.
